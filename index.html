<div class="main">
<p>You have a rapidly expanding Internet presence. Your users
communicate with one another on your email list and your
web forum. They chat with each other on IM or IRC. They say
positive things about you and your org, and feel great about
what you are doing.</p>

<p>In a matter of hours, an infestation of "trolls" can change
all that.</p>

<p>Trolls are Internet users who visit your site with the
intent to cause chaos and destruction for their own
amusement. The trolls confuse and frighten your users with
their time-tested conversational tricks, turning the users
against each other---and against you. Before you know it,
most of your users have fled, and the rest are demoralized
and embittered.  You try to fight back, but nothing you say
or do seems to work.</p>

<p>At Troll University, we have devised a program of training
and certification that will show you how to intercept and
defeat the trolls. We explain where trolls come from and how
they operate. We show you the techniques trolls use to
disrupt your internet presence. We troll you, and you troll
yourselves, in a safe environment.</p>

<p>Then we show you how to handle the trolls and their
techniques.  We show you how to win.</p>

<p>Our commitment to your success doesn't end with our
training. The final stage of our certification process is to
handle our crack Troll Tiger Teams. We troll your Internet
presence, and take careful note of how you handle it. We
probe for weaknesses and suggest areas of improvement.
Your "Troll-Ready Certification" will show that you have
gone beyond passively absorbing concepts. You will be a
warrior, ready to defeat the trolls.</p>
